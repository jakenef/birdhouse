Monorepo scope and boundaries
- This repository is a monorepo with separate `/frontend` and `/backend` folders.
- Frontend agent work is scoped to frontend implementation only.
- Only modify files inside `/frontend/src` unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
- Never modify, create, delete, or refactor anything inside `/backend`.
- Backend files may be read only to understand API endpoints, request/response shapes, and data contracts.
- Do not edit backend code under any circumstance without explicit user instruction.

Frontend architecture rules
- Pages must live in `/frontend/src/pages`.
- Reusable UI components must live in `/frontend/src/components`.
- API logic must live in `/frontend/src/services`.
- Shared TypeScript types must live in `/frontend/src/types`.
- Utility functions must live in `/frontend/src/utils` when needed.
- Keep feature logic modular and colocated by responsibility.

UI and interaction rules
- Build mobile-first responsive interfaces by default.
- Desktop layouts should be clean scale-ups of mobile patterns.
- Property cards must be single tap targets that navigate to `/property/:id`.
- Do not add inline buttons inside property cards.
- Favor accessible touch targets, readable text sizes, and consistent spacing.

Safety and change management
- Do not modify `package.json`, `vite.config.*`, or other config/build files unless explicitly instructed.
- Do not introduce breaking architectural changes.
- Prefer small, reusable, focused React components over large monolithic files.
- Follow existing project conventions before introducing new patterns.
